## Summary
Optimized the cost of linear actuator subjected to constraints imposed by mechanical strength, space restrictions, machining limitations, and functional requirements.
It is mixed integer optimization problem and solved using Monotonicity analysis, SQP with branch and bound method. The genetic algorithm is also used to verify results.
